Q1. 

docker container run -it python:3.12.8 bash
pip --version # pip 24.3.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)

Q2. Connection details to database in pgadmin: hostname is "db" (i.e. first indent on second line).

"5433:5432" is referring to host port : container port. 
HOST_PORT: The port number on your host machine where you want to receive traffic
CONTAINER_PORT: The port number within the container that's listening for connections

e.g. traffic sent to 5433 will be forwarded to port 5432 in the container.

Connect to postgres DB: db:5433
